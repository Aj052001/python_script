# üöÄ Automated CPU & Memory Metrics Collection from Prometheus

## üìå Overview
Previously, to get CPU and Memory usage for Kubernetes nodes, we had to manually open Grafana and check metrics **pod by pod**:
- Max CPU Usage
- Max of Mean CPU Usage
- Max Memory Usage
- Max of Mean Memory Usage  

This was **time-consuming and tedious**.  

Now, this Python script **automates the process** by fetching all metrics **directly from Prometheus**:
- Collects metrics for **all pods at once**.
- Calculates **Max CPU, Max of Mean CPU, Max Memory, Max of Mean Memory** over the **last 7 days**.
- Achieves ~85% accuracy compared to manual checks.  

This reduces manual effort dramatically and ensures consistent results.

## ‚úÖ Features
- Automatic retrieval of CPU & Memory metrics from Prometheus.
- Calculates for **all pods simultaneously**:
  - Max CPU Usage
  - Max of Mean CPU Usage
  - Max Memory Usage
  - Max of Mean Memory Usage
- Configurable time range and queries.
- Export results to **Excel** (or optionally Google Sheets).
- Reduces manual workload from ‚Äúone-by-one pod checking‚Äù to a single script run.
